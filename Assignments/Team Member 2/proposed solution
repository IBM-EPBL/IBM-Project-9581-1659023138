Proposed solution for smart waste management system
Problem statement:
• Smart waste management system would include; a sensor attached to the trash bin that 
measures fill level; and a communication system that transfers this data to Cloud.
• By exploiting this data, trash collection can be planned as well as truck routes can be 
optimized.
Idea/solution description:
• This project deals with the problem of waste management in smart cities, where the 
garbage collection system is not optimized. 
• This system allows the user to know the fill level of each garbage bin in a locality or city 
at all times, to give a cost-effective and time-saving route to the truck drivers.
• The Proposed system consists of main subsystems namely Smart Trash System(STS) and 
Smart Monitoring and Controlling Hut(SMCH).
Novelty/uniqueness:
1. Solar-powered Trash compactors:
• These machines compress trash as it accumulates to increase bin capacity, and 
they collect and transmit data on fill and collection times to help streamline the 
collection process.
2. E-waste kiosks:
 
• Electronic waste that is improperly disposed of can be harmful to both humans 
and the environment. 
• Fortunately, many companies and organizations have started e-waste recycling 
programs that will accept — and even reimburse you for — old electronic 
devices.
3. Recycling Apps:
 
• These apps provide users with information on recycling rates and center 
locations, and their comprehensive lists of materials help users determine 
which items can be recycled.
Social impact/customer satisfaction:
• Improve efficiency - using the resources available to us in a more focused 
and targeted way.
• Reduce the number of bins required - decluttering and improving 
the street scene.
• Drive down our carbon emissions - by doing away with the need to 
drive to bins that still have plenty of space in them.
• Encourage recycling-on-the-go - by ensuring litter bins aren’t 
over-flowing, residents will be encouraged to put the right thing 
in the right bin when they’re out and about.
Business model (Financial Benefit):
1. Reduction in collection cost:
• The solution reduces waste collection frequency dramatically, 
enabling you to save on fuel, labor, and fleet maintenance costs. 
• It has been seen that the solution has reduced the operational 
cost of municipalities up to 80%.
2. No mixed pickups:
• Using the solution, the managers, as well as the garbage truck 
drivers, can see which garbage containers are not picked up and 
needs to be picked.
• So, there will be no missed pickups, keeping the residents away from 
the disease which occurs due to bacteria, vermin and insects 
prosper from the garbage. 
3.Reduced overflows:
• The solution takes care of this issue by allowing the waste 
collectors to keep track of every bin’s fill status and schedule the 
pickup on time.
4.co2 Emission Reduction:
• The solution decreases the fuel consumption which 
ultimately reduces carbon emission by up to 70%.
• This is indeed a huge reduction both in terms of finance and 
environmental impact.
Scalability of solution:
1. Decentralized waste management:
• This is not the waste treatment method but the waste segregation 
method. 
 2. Biological Reprocessing:
• Better known as Composting, this waste management solution is a 
win-win for you. 
 3. Reduce, Recycle & Reuse:
• Recycling not only saves energy but also prevents the materials from 
going to landfills & incineration, and provides raw materials for new 
products. 
• Installing more bins for collecting recyclables like paper, glass, 
plastics, etc., and then recycling them can be a huge step. 
• Also, reuse products wherever possible like reusing plastic bottles 
instead of simply disposing of them. 
• The more you reuse, the more you contribute to keep these items 
away from the garbage can.
